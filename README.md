# MegaMenu Widget

A navigation system designed to operate as an embedded feature — where platform menus are fragile, tightly coupled, and risky to change.

A **decoupled, embeddable MegaMenu widget** delivered as a single versioned JavaScript file.  
It can be embedded into **WordPress, Magento, or static sites** and consumes navigation data from an external API or JSON endpoint.

The widget is designed for **isolation, determinism, and safe navigation evolution** without touching core platform code.

| **Magento / Mage-OS**  | Load page → verify menu renders → change menu data → refresh → menu updates | No core overrides required. Menu logic remains outside the platform.                    |
| **WordPress**          | Load page → widget JS loads → menu renders without theme hooks              | Works reading the Wordpress menu data and remains independent WP or theme templates. |
| **Static site**        | Load page → widget JS `200` → menu renders from remote JSON                 | No server-side integration required.                                                    |
| **Widget host domain** | Network tab shows widget JS loaded once, no duplicate execution             | Widget should remain side-effect free outside its mount point.                          |
